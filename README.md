# ExamEase: Scheduling Student Exams with Graph Coloring and Red Black Trees

- Implemented a Java program to read and process student class schedules and build a graph from the data

- Adopted a greedy algorithm to color the graph and produce a final exam schedule without any student conflicts

- Used a dictionary implemented as a Red Black Tree to differentiate between previously seen course names and new ones
