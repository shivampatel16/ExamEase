# ExamEase: Scheduling Student Exams with Graph Coloring and Red Black Trees

This project was the third among the 5 unique projects of the '95-771 - Data Structure and Algorithms for Information Processing' course at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). Prof. Mike McCarthy, a renowned genius mind in this field, taught the course.

- Implemented a Java program to read and process student class schedules and build a graph from the data

- Adopted a greedy algorithm to color the graph and produce a final exam schedule without any student conflicts

- Used a dictionary implemented as a Red Black Tree to differentiate between previously seen course names and new ones
